              At SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED, we understand that securing and protecting your data is the most important responsibility we have. We have instituted organization wide processes across all our business functions to ensure that we fulfil the responsibility of securing your data. The following sections will give you a more detailed account on some of the systems we have put in place.
        </p>
        <strong>Physical Security</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">The SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED development centre in Sheffield is under 24×7 physical security protection. Only authorized personnel have access to the building and offices. Employees are granted access to the office only after authorization using biometric authentication. Critical locations in the office are accessible only to authorized individuals. Important documents are stored in cabinets accessible only to authorized persons. The office is equipped with surveillance cameras and its images are regularly monitored by authorized persons. A policy has been implemented to approve and regulate visitor access to the building. The office is provided with 24×7 power supply, supported by an alternative uninterrupted power supply system to ensure smooth functioning in the event of power failure. SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED hosts its application and data in industry-leading Amazon Web Services, whose data centres have been thoroughly tested for security, availability and business continuity.</p>
        <strong>Application Security</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED applications and services are all hosted in Amazon Web Services across its multiple regions. The infrastructure for databases and application servers is managed and maintained by the cloud service providers. At SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED, we take an integrated approach to application security, to ensure everything from engineering to deployment, including architecture and quality assurance processes complies with our highest standards of security.</p>
        <strong>Application Architecture</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">
          The application is initially protected by AWS’s firewall which is equipped to counter regular DDoS attacks and other network related intrusions. The second layer of protection is a web application firewall (WAF) which monitors against offending IPs,  users and spam. While the application can be accessed only by users with valid user access, it should be noted that security in cloud-based products is a shared responsibility between the company and the businesses who own those accounts on the cloud. In addition to making it easy for administrators to enforce industry-standard password policies on users, our products also come with features aimed at securing business data on the cloud:
          <ul>
            <li>Role based access</li>
            <li>Sales Groups</li>
            <li>Permission Templates</li>
            <li>Whitelisting IPs for exclusive access</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED uses a multi-tenant data model to host all its applications. Each customer has a separate database and we ensure that the code always fetches the data that belongs to only the logged in tenant. Per this design, no customer has access to another customer’s data. Access to the application by the SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED development team is also controlled, managed and audited. Access to the application and the infrastructure are logged for subsequent audits.</p>
        <strong>Application Engineering and Development</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">We follow secure software development lifecycle, where security testing is part of development, testing and pre-release acceptance. A security review is a mandatory part of application engineering (development and construction) process at SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED.</p>
        <strong>Software Changes and Release Management</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">Changes in our production environment follow a very well-defined, systematic process from development and test environments to verifying the changes finally on staging before production deployment. Production deployments are only done by authorized Development team members, and nobody else has access to our production environment.</p>
        <strong>Production Monitoring</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">We have a dedicated 24×7 NOC team that monitors the application for suspicious activities or attacks. We conduct regular external third-party audits to certify the state of security in our applications and services.</p>
        <strong>Data Security</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED takes the protection and security of its customers’ data very seriously. SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED manages the security of its application and customers’ data. The SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED development team has no access to data on production servers. Changes to the application, infrastructure, web content and deployment processes are documented extensively as part of an internal change control process.

Data at rest is encrypted using <span class="text-red">AES-256 bit standards (key strength – 1024)</span> with the keys being managed by AWS Key Management Service. <span class="text-red">All data in transit is encrypted using FIPS-140-2 standard encryption over a secure socket connection for all accounts hosted with us.</span> Different environments are in use for development and testing purposes, access to systems are strictly managed, based on the principles of need to do/know basis appropriate to the information classification, with Segregation of Duties built in, and reviewed on a quarterly basis.</p>
        <strong>Data Deletion</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">When your account with us is terminated, we ensure that all your data is deleted cleanly. The details are listed in <span class="text-red">our terms of service</span></p>
        <strong>Network Security</strong><br>
        <p class="mt-3">The SAMS GLOBAL SOLUTIONS LIMITED office network where updates are developed, deployed, monitored and managed is secured by industry-grade firewalls and antivirus software, to protect internal information systems from intrusion and to provide active alerts in the event of a threat or an incident.
